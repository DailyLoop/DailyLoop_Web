        "summary": "President Trump and Elon Musk appeared together in the Oval Office to defend their efforts to cut government spending through Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative. They claim to have found billions in waste and plan to reduce the federal workforce. The executive order issued provides guidelines for agencies to work with DOGE, limit hiring, and consult with a DOGE Team Lead. The changes do not apply to military personnel and exempt positions related to national security. Legal challenges have arisen against DOGE actions, with federal courts blocking access to sensitive materials. Musk addressed concerns about transparency and conflicts of interest, stating that DOGE actions are posted online.",

        "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified that further interest rate cuts are not needed at the moment due to a strong job market and elevated inflation. Powell also addressed questions about President Trump's economic policies and the Fed's bank supervision, emphasizing the need to stay out of politics. Powell mentioned that any future rate cuts will depend on inflation cooling and job market conditions. He also highlighted uncertainties related to Trump's tariff policies potentially affecting inflation and the Fed's ability to lower rates. Powell assured that the Fed will review its bank supervision manual in response to concerns about discouraging banks from working with certain businesses. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the Trump administration for effectively shutting down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, urging Powell not to support the funding cuts for the agency.",

Trump suggested moving Palestinians to \"parcels\" in third countries, including Jordan. Abdullah expressed discomfort with the plan and emphasized the importance of finding a solution beneficial for all parties. Trump is serious about his plan, which involves Egypt and Jordan accepting millions of Palestinian refugees. He hinted at using American aid as leverage but later backtracked on threatening to withhold aid. The proposal has raised concerns about destabilizing security partners and the region. Trump's plan lacks support from Arab countries and faces challenges in implementation.",
