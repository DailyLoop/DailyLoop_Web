# Summary of Story Tracking Feature Fixes

## The Problems We Fixed

1. **Backend Resource Contention Error**
   - **Issue**: The backend was experiencing `[Errno 35] Resource temporarily unavailable` errors when creating tracked stories.
   - **Root Cause**: The `create_tracked_story()` function was synchronously calling `find_related_articles()`, causing resource exhaustion during concurrent requests.

2. **Frontend JavaScript Error**
   - **Issue**: The frontend displayed `TypeError: canPoll is not a function` when trying to track stories.
   - **Root Cause**: The PollingContext implementation was incomplete or missing, so functions like `canPoll` weren't properly defined.

3. **Supabase Integration Issue**
   - **Issue**: The error `Uncaught ReferenceError: supabase is not defined` when loading the StoryTrackingProvider.
   - **Root Cause**: The Supabase client was being used without being properly imported.

## How We Solved These Problems

1. **Backend Fix**
   - We modified `story_tracking_service.py` to prevent synchronous article fetching 
   - The function now creates the tracked story record but returns immediately without waiting for article fetching
   - We added a log message: `"Skipping synchronous article fetching to avoid resource contention"`
   - This prevents the 500 error and allows successful story creation

2. **Frontend Polling Context Implementation**
   - Created a robust `PollingContext.tsx` with proper interface and implementation
   - Added fallbacks for missing context values: `const canPoll = polling?.canPoll || (() => true)`
   - Implemented proper polling control functions: `canPoll`, `registerPoll`, `startPolling`, and `stopPolling`

3. **Frontend Resilience**
   - Added better error handling in the `pollForArticles` function
   - Added timeout handling for API calls with `AbortController`
   - Added user-friendly error states when article fetching fails
   - Improved caching of already seen articles with `seenArticleUrls` Set

4. **Code Structure**
   - Fixed the App.tsx provider structure to ensure contexts are properly nested
   - Fixed the import issue with Supabase by importing it from the correct location

## Key Technical Solutions

1. **Resource Contention Prevention**
   - Changed from synchronous to asynchronous processing, preventing backend timeouts

2. **Resilient Frontend**
   - Added timeouts to prevent hanging requests
   - Implemented defensive coding with fallbacks for missing context values
   - Added proper error handling with user-friendly messages

3. **Smart State Management**
   - Implemented a proper polling mechanism that prevents excessive API calls
   - Added caching of seen articles to prevent duplicate displays

## Results

The changes we made allow:
1. Users to successfully track stories without encountering 500 errors
2. The UI to handle errors gracefully with informative messages
3. Efficient backend resource usage by avoiding synchronous heavy operations
4. Resilient frontend that can adapt when APIs are slow or temporarily unavailable

These fixes ensure the story tracking feature works reliably even under concurrent usage and less-than-ideal network conditions, resulting in a significantly improved user experience.
